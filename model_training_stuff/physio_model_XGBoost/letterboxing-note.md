**Your current code does not adjust the face bounding boxes for letterboxing!**
Let's break this down carefully:

---

## **How It Currently Works**

* You letterbox each frame with `letterbox_resize(frame, (640, 360))`, which returns `frame, scale, (pad_left, pad_top)`.
* **But:**
  You run face detection and tracking on the letterboxed frame, so all further processing (face ROI, mask, feature extraction) is done on these padded, resized frames.
* **Boxes from face detector are already in the letterboxed frame coordinates.**
  So, as long as you *always* process face detection, tracking, mask extraction, and rPPG **in the letterboxed (padded+resized) frames**, you are safe and do not need to adjust the box coordinates further.

---

## **When Would You Need Adjustment?**

* **If you wanted to map face boxes back to the original frame,** you would have to de-normalize/undo the scale and padding.
* **If you ran detection/tracking on the original (non-letterboxed) frame, but wanted to use boxes on the letterboxed frame,** you’d have to rescale and offset (by pad\_left, pad\_top).

---

## **What Your Code Actually Does**

* Every time you read a frame:

  ```python
  frame, scale, (pad_left, pad_top) = letterbox_resize(frame, (640, 360))
  ```

  * This means that the `frame` used for face detection is *already* letterboxed.
* You run:

  ```python
  boxes = detect_faces_dnn(frame, face_net)
  ```

  * Boxes are in letterboxed frame coordinates.
* **All downstream use of boxes, masks, and ROIs are consistently on these letterboxed frames.**

---

## **Conclusion**

* **You do not need to manually adjust face bounding boxes for the letterboxing step, given your current flow.**
* Everything is already in the correct, padded/resized coordinate space.
* If you ever want to visualize boxes on the *original* frames, or map anything *back*, then you need to apply the inverse transform:

  * `(orig_x, orig_y) = ((x - pad_left) / scale, (y - pad_top) / scale)`

## **Checklist for Letterboxing Pipelines**

* [x] Face detection and all per-frame ops are run on the same (letterboxed) image? **→ YES**
* [x] Boxes are not reused across differently scaled/padded frames? **→ YES**
* [x] Masks, features, and rPPG all use same coordinates? **→ YES**

---

## **Bottom Line**

> **Your code already handles letterboxing correctly for downstream processing because all operations are performed within the resized+letterboxed frames. You do not need extra adjustments for box coordinates.**

---

If you ever want to map boxes back to the original frame, or do any late fusion with features computed on non-letterboxed data, **that’s when you’ll need to adjust for scale/padding.**
Let me know if you want that code!

**TL;DR:**

> **You’re good. No changes needed for your current pipeline.**
